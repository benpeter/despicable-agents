# Software-Docs Review: ADVISE

1. **Line reference accuracy**: Don't hardcode line numbers for orchestration.md edits. Use grep to find the correct location.
2. **Checklist renumbering**: Be explicit about whether to use "4a" notation or renumber steps 5-15.
3. **Cross-reference consistency**: Confirm both orchestration.md and TEMPLATE.md use "Original Prompt" terminology after edits.
