# Phase 3.5 Review: lucy

**Verdict: ADVISE**

1. Task 6 Part C: broaden stale-doc link search — grep ALL docs/*.md, not just architecture.md
2. README 100-130 line target is tight with `<details>` element — execution concern, not plan concern
3. Minor: Task 6 Part C prompt correctly says "check if" rather than asserting references exist
4. Scope containment verified: no changes to the-plan.md, AGENT.md, RESEARCH.md, CLAUDE.md, install.sh
5. CLAUDE.md compliance verified: English, no PII, Helix Manifesto principles respected
