# Phase 3.5 Review: margo

**Verdict: ADVISE**

1. Positioning strategy doc (Task 1) may be write-once-read-never — keep lean, consider folding essentials into task prompts
2. Agent catalog (Task 3) creates maintenance liability — file follow-up for automation script after execution
3. Phase 8 triage: monitor after 3-5 orchestrations for false positives (marketing review on minor changes). Simplify if criteria generate noise.
4. Plan is proportional overall — 7 tasks for docs restructure + process change is reasonable
