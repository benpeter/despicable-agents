# Phase 3.5 Review: software-docs-minion

**Verdict: ADVISE**

1. Link fragmentation: archived docs may be referenced from execution reports — update paths
2. Collapsible `<details>` HTML is GitHub-specific — acceptable, document if portability needed
3. Cross-document tone consistency: add verification step comparing language across user-facing docs
4. Agent catalog maintenance: document workflow trigger in header ("update when AGENT.md changes")
