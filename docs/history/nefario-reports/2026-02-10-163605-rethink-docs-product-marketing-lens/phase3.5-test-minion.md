# Phase 3.5 Review: test-minion

**Verdict: ADVISE**

1. Link verification should be programmatic (grep-based), not manual
2. SKILL.md surgical edit needs before/after diff verification
3. Cross-link verification scope should be explicit (automated file-existence checks)
4. Agent catalog accuracy: spot-check 3-5 entries against AGENT.md source
5. README line count should be enforced during execution with iterate-to-reduce instruction
6. Phase 8 spec should include example triage scenario as reference test case
