# Phase 3.5 Review: ux-strategy-minion

**Verdict: ADVISE**

1. Line count pressure may force UX tradeoffs — protect explanatory content in "Try It"
2. Agent catalog decision guide should be scannable patterns/decision tree, not prose
3. Progressive disclosure: test collapsed roster state — can user find specialist without expanding?
4. "Try It" examples should be outcome-focused ("Need to validate auth? ...") not command-centric
5. Gate 1 should include UX validation: can unfamiliar developer grasp value prop in 10 seconds?
6. No friction baseline — methodological gap, non-blocking given strong specialist analysis
