VERDICT: ADVISE

1. Success criteria says "--skip-post is replaced by" but plan preserves --skip-post as shorthand. Correct design choice but contradicts literal wording. Confirm with user.
2. Task 2 "proceed directly to Wrap-up" is functionally equivalent to current "skip to Wrap-up" but language is slightly weaker. Low risk.
3. Scope says "Out: agent specs" but Task 4 edits AGENT.md/AGENT.overrides.md. These are operational overlays, not the-plan.md specs. Borderline but necessary for consistency.
