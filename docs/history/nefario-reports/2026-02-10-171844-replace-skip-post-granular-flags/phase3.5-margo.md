VERDICT: ADVISE

1. Two-tier interaction adds unnecessary layer. A flat 4-option single-select works:
   1. "Run all" (default)
   2. "Skip docs"
   3. "Skip tests"
   4. "Skip review"
   Skip-all users type --skip-post in freeform text. Eliminates "Customize" concept and inter-tier precedence rules.

2. Verification summary format too elaborate (5 variants, "Skipped:" suffix convention). Simpler: list only what ran, omit what didn't. Self-documenting.
