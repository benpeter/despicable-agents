VERDICT: ADVISE

1. Add consequence signals to skip option descriptions (e.g., "Skip review (no security/quality checks)")
2. Verify CONDENSE line omits skipped phases when skip comes from freeform text
3. Add verification step for freeform override precedence (user selects "Run all" but types --skip-docs)
4. Future: audit trail for skip decisions (informational, not required)
