# Margo Review: despicable-prompter-ref-using-nefario

## Verdict: APPROVE

This plan is proportional to the task. One task, one agent, two sentences inserted into one file. No new dependencies, no abstractions, no code, no architecture changes.

Observations:

- **Scope**: Perfectly aligned. The request is "add a reference," the plan adds exactly a reference. No scope creep.
- **Complexity budget**: Near zero. A two-sentence markdown edit costs effectively nothing.
- **Cross-cutting review note**: The plan itself correctly identifies that the full 6-agent architecture review battery is disproportionate for a two-sentence doc edit. I agree. This review pass is already generous for the scope involved.
- **YAGNI**: No violations. The plan explicitly caps the insertion at two sentences and forbids expansion into examples, tip boxes, or secondary references. Good discipline.

No simplification recommendations -- this is already as simple as it gets.
