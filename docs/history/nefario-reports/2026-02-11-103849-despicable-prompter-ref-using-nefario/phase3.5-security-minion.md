# Security Review: despicable-prompter-ref-using-nefario

**Verdict**: APPROVE

**Rationale**: This is a documentation-only change (two-sentence markdown insertion). No code execution, no data processing, no authentication, no external dependencies, no user input handling, and no attack surface introduced. The synthesis correctly identified security as not applicable. No security concerns.
