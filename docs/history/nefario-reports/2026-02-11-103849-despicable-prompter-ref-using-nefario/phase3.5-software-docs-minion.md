The documentation plan is architecturally sound:

1. **Information architecture** -- The insertion point (after "less helpful examples") is symptom-adjacent and follows progressive disclosure principles. Users encounter the tool reference at the moment of peak need.

2. **Document consistency** -- The planned text matches the existing document's tone (direct, imperative, no callout boxes). The phrase "ready to paste and run" mirrors terminology from the prompter skill itself.

3. **Cross-referencing pattern** -- The reference is contextual (embedded in narrative flow) rather than isolated (sidebar/tip box). This matches how the document references orchestration.md at the bottom.

4. **Scope boundaries** -- The constraint to insert exactly two sentences without expanding prevents scope creep and maintains the document's current density.

5. **Single source of truth** -- The reference points to the `/despicable-prompter` skill. If the tool changes, the two-sentence reference is trivial to update. No duplication risk.

No blocking concerns from documentation architecture perspective.
