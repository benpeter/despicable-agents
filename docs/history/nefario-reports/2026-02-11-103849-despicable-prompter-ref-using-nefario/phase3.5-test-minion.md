# Test-Minion Review: despicable-prompter-ref-using-nefario

## Verdict: APPROVE

## Assessment

This plan adds a two-sentence documentation reference to `docs/using-nefario.md`. From the test domain perspective:

- **No executable code produced**: This is pure markdown text insertion. No test coverage is applicable.
- **No test infrastructure changes**: No test files, test scripts, or CI configuration affected.
- **Documentation change only**: The file being modified (`docs/using-nefario.md`) is user-facing documentation, not code.
- **Verification approach is appropriate**: The plan includes manual verification steps (read file, confirm placement, check for unintended changes). This is the correct verification strategy for a markdown edit.

The plan explicitly states "Testing: Not applicable" in the cross-cutting coverage section. This assessment is correct.

No test-related concerns from this domain.
