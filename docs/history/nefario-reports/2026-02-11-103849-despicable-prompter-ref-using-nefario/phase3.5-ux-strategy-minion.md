# UX Strategy Review: despicable-prompter-ref-using-nefario

## Verdict: APPROVE

## Assessment

This delegation plan demonstrates excellent application of UX strategy principles:

**Symptom-Adjacent Help Placement (Progressive Disclosure)**
The insertion point is optimal. Users who just read "less helpful examples" are experiencing peak awareness that their prompt needs improvement. Placing the reference immediately after the code block turns a moment of confusion into a learning opportunity. This is textbook progressive disclosure -- offer the tool at the moment of need.

**Cognitive Load Management**
Two sentences is the right scope. More would interrupt reading flow and compete with the upcoming "What Happens" section. The reference is scannable, actionable, and doesn't demand deep processing.

**Normalizing Tone Reduces Friction**
"If you have a rough idea" is non-judgmental and inclusive. This lowers the psychological barrier to trying the tool. Users are more likely to explore a tool when they don't feel criticized for needing it.

**Discoverability Without Intrusion**
The reference avoids callout boxes, tip formatting, or heading structure. It reads as natural prose rather than interrupting the document structure. This maintains the existing document's clean, direct tone while still being discoverable.

**Action-Oriented Language**
"Ready to paste and run" reduces uncertainty about what happens next. Users know the tool output is immediately usable with `/nefario`, which lowers activation energy.

## Minor Observation (Non-Blocking)

The phrase "run `/despicable-prompter` with your idea first" uses "first" which creates a subtle ordering constraint. Consider whether users might interpret this as "you must always use the prompter before nefario" versus "when you're unsure, this tool helps." The current wording is acceptable, but if future feedback suggests users feel obligated rather than empowered, revisiting that word might help.

This is not a blocking concern -- the overall framing is inviting, and the "if you have a rough idea but are not sure" condition already scopes appropriately.

## Conclusion

The plan demonstrates strong understanding of user journey and friction reduction. The placement, tone, and scope align with simplification principles. No changes needed from a UX strategy perspective.
