# Margo Review: /despicable-prompter reference in using-nefario.md

## VERDICT: APPROVE

## Assessment

**Change scope**: One sentence inserted at line 58 of `docs/using-nefario.md`. No other files touched. No other lines modified.

**Proportionality**: The task asked for a short reference to `/despicable-prompter` near the "less helpful examples" section. The change delivers exactly that -- one sentence, correctly placed, zero extras. The synthesis plan specified two sentences; the executing agent condensed to one, which is even leaner. This is the right instinct.

**Complexity cost**: Zero. No new abstractions, no new dependencies, no new files, no structural changes. A single paragraph of plain prose in a markdown file.

**YAGNI check**: Nothing was added beyond what was requested. No tip boxes, no admonition wrappers, no secondary references elsewhere in the document, no expanded examples of despicable-prompter usage. The agent resisted the temptation to over-explain.

**Placement and tone**: The sentence sits at the optimal position -- immediately after the "less helpful examples" code block where users are most aware their prompt needs work. Tone matches the surrounding text: direct, imperative, normalizing ("if you have a rough idea" rather than "if your prompt is too vague").

## Findings

None. The change is proportional, minimal, and correctly scoped.
