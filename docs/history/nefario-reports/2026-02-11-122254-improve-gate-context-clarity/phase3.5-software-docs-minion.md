APPROVE

File update order matches recommended dependency chain (SKILL.md → AGENT.overrides.md + AGENT.md → docs/orchestration.md). All identified files are covered. Three-way sync risk (SKILL.md, AGENT.overrides.md, AGENT.md) is adequately mitigated through Task 2's explicit dual-sync approach. Task prompts contain clear verification criteria that confirm Decision Brief Format identity across all three files.

The report template (TEMPLATE.md) exclusion is correct -- the gate brief format in reports is a summarized outcome record, and the enhancements add context fields useful at decision time but not for historical record.

Line budget guidance is appropriate (12-18 lines target for mid-exec gates, with soft ceiling principle retained).

No documentation concerns.
