## Software-docs-minion Review: ADVISE

1. Cross-reference audit incomplete: Task 9 does not verify internal doc links resolve correctly
2. Decision 27 formatting assumes specific file structure at insertion point
3. Narrative coherence of build-pipeline.md after removing Merge Step not verified

All low-risk. Task 9 grep sweep will catch broken references. Manual review catches narrative issues.
