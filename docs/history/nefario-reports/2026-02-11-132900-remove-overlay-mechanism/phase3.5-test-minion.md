## Test-minion Review: ADVISE

No test coverage for the nefario skip condition in SKILL.md. However, consistent with project's current testing approach (no tests for SKILL.md behavior in general). The skip behavior will be validated through manual use.

Recommendations (non-blocking):
- Manually verify skip condition after deployment
- Task 9 should check error message quality from Task 4
