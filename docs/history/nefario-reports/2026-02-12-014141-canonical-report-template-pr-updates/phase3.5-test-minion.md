APPROVE

This is a documentation-only change (editing SKILL.md markdown, deleting TEMPLATE.md). No executable code is produced. The plan correctly identifies this in the Cross-Cutting Coverage section and appropriately excludes test execution from the workflow.

Validation will be manual (comparing template structure against issue success criteria, verifying template is well-formed markdown). This is the correct approach for template content.

The only testable aspect (build-index.sh compatibility with v3 frontmatter) is already covered in Task 3's verification step.
