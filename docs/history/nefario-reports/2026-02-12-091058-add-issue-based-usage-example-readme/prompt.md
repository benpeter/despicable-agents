Add issue-based usage example to README

**Outcome**: The README Examples section includes a concrete example showing how to run `/nefario #42` to have the agent team tackle a GitHub issue using the full 9-phase orchestration process, so that new users immediately see the issue-driven workflow.

**Success criteria**:
- README Examples section contains a `/nefario #<issue>` example
- Example conveys the end-to-end flow (issue in, PR out) in 1-2 sentences
- Existing examples are unchanged

**Scope**:
- In: README.md Examples section
- Out: Other README sections, docs/ files, skill definitions
