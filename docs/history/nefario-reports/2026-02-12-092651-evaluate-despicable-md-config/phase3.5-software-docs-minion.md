## Review Verdict: software-docs-minion

ADVISE

1. **Missing consuming-projects guide**: Decision 29 captures the "what" and "why" but not actionable guidance for consuming projects. Developers won't know how to implement the recommended section convention. Recommend a short guide (200-300 lines) showing example CLAUDE.md sections, precedence rules, configurable vs hard-constrained preferences.

2. **Format consistency verified**: Proposed decision format matches conventions in existing decisions.md.

Both non-blocking. Decision document sufficient for consultation; guide addresses usability gap for future adopters.
