You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-ymv695/add-user-approval-gate-phase2-team-selection/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence and intent alignment: Does the plan follow the project's established patterns for gates (AskUserQuestion format, Communication Protocol, CONDENSE conventions)? Does it honor the scope boundaries from the issue (no AGENT.md changes, no the-plan.md changes)? Is the "NEVER skip" enforcement model correctly extended?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
