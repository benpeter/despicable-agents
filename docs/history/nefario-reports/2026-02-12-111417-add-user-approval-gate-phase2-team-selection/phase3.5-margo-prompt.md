You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-ymv695/add-user-approval-gate-phase2-team-selection/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Simplicity and YAGNI: Is the gate design the minimum viable intervention? Are there unnecessary features in the plan (e.g., the ALSO AVAILABLE list, the 2-round adjustment cap, the calibration counter exemption)? Could any of these be deferred? Is the plan over-engineering the solution?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
