You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-ymv695/add-user-approval-gate-phase2-team-selection/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage: The task modifies SKILL.md (prose/workflow instructions) and docs. Are there any testable behaviors that should be validated? Consider whether the gate's interaction patterns (approve/adjust/reject flows) can be tested, or if this is purely prose changes with no executable test surface.

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
