You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-ymv695/add-user-approval-gate-phase2-team-selection/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Usability strategy: Does the gate design achieve the right balance between user control and friction? Is the 5-12 line budget realistic? Does the "Adjust team" freeform flow create cognitive burden? Is the relationship between this gate and the execution plan gate clear to users?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
