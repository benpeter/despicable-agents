You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1CcD5T/rework-phase-3-5-reviewer-composition/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, and intent alignment. Specifically:
- Does the plan stay within the declared scope of issue #49? (In: Phase 3.5 triggering rules, rosters, software-docs-minion role, Phase 8 handoff, AGENT.md, SKILL.md, orchestration.md. Out: Phase 2 gate, reviewer AGENT.md files, the-plan.md, Phase 5/6)
- Are the changes consistent with existing repo conventions (CLAUDE.md rules)?
- Does the plan drift from the user's original intent?
- Are there any "Does NOT do" boundary violations for the agents involved?
- Is the cross-cutting checklist clarification (planning vs. review scope) correctly framed?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
