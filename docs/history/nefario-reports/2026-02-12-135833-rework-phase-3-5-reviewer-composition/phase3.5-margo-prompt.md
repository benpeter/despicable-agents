You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1CcD5T/rework-phase-3-5-reviewer-composition/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI violations, and unnecessary complexity. Specifically:
- Is the domain signal table over-engineered for what is essentially a 6-item selection?
- Is the checklist format (markdown checkboxes with owner tags, scope, file paths, priority) too elaborate?
- Does the plan add unnecessary abstraction layers or future-proofing?
- Could any of the 4 tasks be consolidated without losing clarity?
- Is the Phase 8 "merge operation" pattern adding complexity beyond what's needed?
- Are the gate options and auto-skip logic the simplest solution that works?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1CcD5T/rework-phase-3-5-reviewer-composition/phase3.5-margo.md
