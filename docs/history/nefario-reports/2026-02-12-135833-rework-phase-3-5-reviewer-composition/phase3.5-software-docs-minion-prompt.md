You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1CcD5T/rework-phase-3-5-reviewer-composition/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Documentation coverage and consistency of the delegation plan. Specifically:
- Will the AGENT.md changes (Task 1) and SKILL.md changes (Tasks 2-3) be internally consistent?
- Does the orchestration.md update (Task 4) accurately reflect the new Phase 3.5 structure?
- Is the documentation impact checklist format well-defined enough for Phase 8 consumption?
- Are there documentation gaps between the three target files?
- Does the cross-cutting clarification sentence (Task 1) correctly scope planning vs. review inclusion?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
