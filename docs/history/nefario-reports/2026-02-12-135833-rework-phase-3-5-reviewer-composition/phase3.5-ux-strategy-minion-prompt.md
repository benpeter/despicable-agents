You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1CcD5T/rework-phase-3-5-reviewer-composition/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
UX and usability of the Phase 3.5 reviewer gate design. Specifically:
- Does the gate interaction model avoid approval fatigue (this is the second team-composition gate in a session)?
- Is the information density right for discretionary picks with one-line rationales?
- Are the gate options (Approve/Adjust/Skip review) clear and appropriate?
- Is the auto-skip behavior (when no discretionary reviewers triggered) a good UX decision?
- Does the header "Review" (not "Team") create sufficient differentiation from the Phase 2 gate?
- Is the 6-10 line target appropriate for this gate?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
