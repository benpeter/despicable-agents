You are updating the orchestration architecture documentation to reflect the
new Phase 3.5 reviewer composition model.

## What to Do

Edit `/Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/orchestration.md`.

### A. Update Phase 3.5 section

Find the Phase 3.5 section (search for "Phase 3.5" or "Architecture Review").
Replace the "Review triggering rules" table with two tables: mandatory and
discretionary. Use the exact rosters:

**Mandatory reviewers (ALWAYS):**

| Reviewer | Trigger | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| security-minion | ALWAYS | Security violations in a plan are invisible until exploited |
| test-minion | ALWAYS | Retrofitting test coverage is consistently more expensive than designing it in |
| software-docs-minion | ALWAYS | Produces documentation impact checklist for Phase 8 (impact assessment, not full review) |
| lucy | ALWAYS | Every plan must align with human intent, repo conventions, and CLAUDE.md compliance |
| margo | ALWAYS | Every plan must pass YAGNI/KISS/simplicity enforcement |

**Discretionary reviewers (selected by nefario, approved by user):**

| Reviewer | Domain Signal |
|----------|--------------|
| ux-strategy-minion | Plan includes user-facing workflow or journey changes |
| ux-design-minion | 1+ tasks produce user-facing interfaces |
| accessibility-minion | 1+ tasks produce web-facing UI |
| sitespeed-minion | 1+ tasks produce web-facing runtime components |
| observability-minion | 2+ tasks produce runtime components needing coordinated observability |
| user-docs-minion | Plan output changes what end users see, do, or need to learn |

Add a paragraph after the discretionary table explaining the approval gate:

> Before spawning reviewers, nefario presents its discretionary picks to the
> user via a Reviewer Approval Gate. The user can approve the reviewer set,
> adjust discretionary picks (constrained to the 6-member pool, 2-round
> adjustment cap), or skip architecture review entirely to proceed directly
> to the Execution Plan Approval Gate.

Update the model selection line to keep current language:
"All reviewers run on **sonnet** except lucy and margo, which run on **opus**
(governance judgment requires deep reasoning)."

Update the software-docs-minion description in the verdict format paragraph
to note that software-docs-minion produces a documentation impact checklist
rather than a standard domain review, and should not BLOCK for documentation
concerns.

### B. Update Phase 8 section

Find the Phase 8 section. Update the first paragraph to mention the Phase 3.5
checklist handoff:

> Runs when nefario's documentation checklist has items. The checklist is
> generated by merging the Phase 3.5 documentation impact checklist (produced
> by software-docs-minion during architecture review, if available) with
> execution-outcome items identified at the Phase 7-to-8 boundary. If Phase
> 3.5 was skipped, the checklist is generated entirely from execution outcomes.

### C. Update Mermaid sequence diagram

Find the Mermaid sequence diagram. In the Phase 3.5 section of the diagram,
add the Reviewer Approval Gate between "Determine reviewers" and "Parallel Review":

```
Note over Main,Rev: Phase 3.5: Architecture Review
Main->>Main: Determine mandatory + discretionary reviewers

Note over User,Main: Reviewer Approval Gate
Main->>User: Discretionary picks with rationale
User->>Main: Approve / Adjust / Skip review

alt Skip review
    Main->>Main: Skip to Execution Plan Approval Gate
else Proceed with review
    par Parallel Review
        Main->>Rev: Task(review synthesized plan)
        Rev->>Main: Verdict (APPROVE / ADVISE / BLOCK)
    end
```

Keep the existing BLOCK resolution loop and compaction checkpoint unchanged.

### D. Do NOT modify these sections

- Phase 1 (Meta-Plan) -- already mentions Team Approval Gate, no changes needed
- Phase 2 (Specialist Planning) -- unchanged
- Phase 3 (Synthesis) -- unchanged
- Phase 4 (Execution) -- unchanged
- Phase 5-7 -- unchanged
- Section 2 (Delegation Model) -- unchanged
- Section 3 (Approval Gates) -- unchanged (the Reviewer Approval Gate follows
  the same pattern as the Team Approval Gate already documented there)

## Context

- Read the final state of AGENT.md and SKILL.md (modified by Tasks 1-3) to
  ensure documentation matches implementation
- The Mermaid diagram needs to show the new gate as a distinct step
- software-docs-minion's role change from "full review" to "documentation
  impact checklist" should be reflected throughout

## Deliverables

Updated `/Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/orchestration.md` with:
1. New ALWAYS/discretionary reviewer tables in Phase 3.5
2. Reviewer Approval Gate description
3. Updated Phase 8 checklist source description
4. Updated Mermaid sequence diagram

## Success Criteria

- Reviewer tables match the AGENT.md roster exactly
- Reviewer Approval Gate is documented between reviewer identification and
  reviewer spawning
- Phase 8 description mentions Phase 3.5 checklist handoff
- Mermaid diagram shows the new gate
- software-docs-minion described as documentation impact checklist, not full review
- No unrelated sections modified

When you finish your task, mark it completed with TaskUpdate and send a message
to the team lead with:
- File paths with change scope and line counts
- 1-2 sentence summary of what was produced
