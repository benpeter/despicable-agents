You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mhoPIa/rerun-on-roster-changes/phase3-synthesis.md

Also read for context:
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/skills/nefario/SKILL.md (lines 379-457 Team Gate, 608-703 Reviewer Gate)
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/CLAUDE.md
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/orchestration.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, intent drift. Specifically:
- Does the plan preserve the user-control intent of the gates?
- Do the conflict resolutions (adjustment cap counting, invisible override, output file naming) align with project conventions?
- Is the scope contained to what was requested (no feature creep)?
- Does the task prompt language match SKILL.md's existing voice and formatting?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: list specific non-blocking warnings
- BLOCK: describe the blocking issue and what must change

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
