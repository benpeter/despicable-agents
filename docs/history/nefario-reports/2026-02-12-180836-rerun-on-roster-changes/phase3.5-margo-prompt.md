You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mhoPIa/rerun-on-roster-changes/phase3-synthesis.md

Also read the current SKILL.md for context: /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/skills/nefario/SKILL.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI, dependency bloat, unnecessary complexity. Specifically:
- Is the re-run mechanism the simplest solution that meets the requirements?
- Is the 4-task breakdown justified or could tasks be consolidated?
- Are the conflict resolutions over-engineered (e.g., separate re-run cap on top of adjustment cap)?
- Is there any speculative functionality being added that isn't needed yet?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: list specific non-blocking warnings
- BLOCK: describe the blocking issue and what must change

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
Write findings to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mhoPIa/rerun-on-roster-changes/phase3.5-margo.md
