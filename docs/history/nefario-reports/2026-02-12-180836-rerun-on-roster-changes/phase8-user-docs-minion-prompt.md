You are updating user-facing documentation to reflect changes to the nefario
orchestration gates.

## Task
Update docs/using-nefario.md with brief notes about the re-run behavior at
the Team and Reviewer approval gates.

## File
/Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/using-nefario.md

## What to Update

1. **Phase 1 description** (around line 102): The current text mentions
   adjusting the team. Extend to note that large team changes trigger a
   planning refresh for better coverage. One clause, not a paragraph.

2. **Phase 3.5 description** (around line 108): Currently does not mention
   reviewer adjustment at all. Add one clause about reviewer adjustments
   triggering re-evaluation when changes are substantial. Low priority (COULD).

## Style Constraints
- This is a user-facing guide. Keep language accessible and brief.
- Do NOT use internal terms like "adjustment classification" or "substantial path."
- Use language like "large changes" or "significant changes" instead.
- One clause per update, not paragraphs.

## What NOT to Do
- Do NOT rewrite existing paragraphs
- Do NOT add procedural details that belong in SKILL.md
- Do NOT modify any other files
