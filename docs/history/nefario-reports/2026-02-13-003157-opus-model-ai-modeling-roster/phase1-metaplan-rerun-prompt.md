MODE: META-PLAN

You are creating a revised meta-plan after the user adjusted the team.

## Original Task

<github-issue>
## Problem

The agent system has a structural bias against serverless infrastructure. When starting greenfield projects, it recommends Docker + Terraform + reverse proxy stacks even when `vercel deploy` (1 command, zero config) would suffice. The bias is not an explicit rule -- it emerges from three compounding gaps.

### Gap 1: iac-minion has zero serverless knowledge
### Gap 2: margo's complexity budget penalizes novelty, not operational burden
### Gap 3: Delegation table has no serverless routing

## Solution

Four coordinated changes, no new agent: expand iac-minion spec (1.0 -> 1.1), recalibrate margo spec (1.0 -> 1.1), update delegation table, provide CLAUDE.md template for target projects. Edge-minion framing update for Workers/Pages as full-stack serverless.

## What NOT to do
- Do NOT create a 28th agent
- Do NOT hardcode "serverless-first" in AGENT.md
- Do NOT edit AGENT.md or RESEARCH.md directly -- those are generated by /despicable-lab
- Do NOT make margo block self-hosted proposals
</github-issue>

Additional context: use opus for all agents, make ai-modeling part of the roster

## Original Meta-Plan

The following meta-plan was produced for the original team. Use it as context for the revised plan, not as a template to minimally edit.

Read the original meta-plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-pK8eRN/opus-model-ai-modeling-roster/phase1-metaplan.md

## User's Team Adjustment

Added: lucy
Removed: iac-minion, software-docs-minion

Revised team: margo, edge-minion, devx-minion, ai-modeling-minion, lucy

User note: "edge-minion's opinions weigh stronger than devx-minion" -- edge-minion's domain perspective should take priority over devx-minion when they conflict on deployment strategy boundaries.

## Working Directory
/Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/4

## Constraint Directives

- Keep the same scope and task description
- Preserve external skill integration decisions unless the team change removes all agents relevant to a skill's domain
- Generate planning consultations for ALL agents in the revised team (margo, edge-minion, devx-minion, ai-modeling-minion, lucy)
- Re-evaluate the cross-cutting checklist against the new team
- Produce output at the same depth and format as the original
- Do NOT change the fundamental scope of the task
- Do NOT add agents the user did not request (beyond cross-cutting requirements)
- Design planning questions as a coherent set -- each question should address aspects that no other agent on the team covers, and questions should reference cross-cutting boundaries where relevant

## Instructions
1. Read the original meta-plan for context
2. Generate revised planning consultations for the 5-agent team
3. Lucy replaces iac-minion for governance alignment of spec changes and replaces software-docs-minion for consistency checks
4. Ensure edge-minion's consultation addresses the boundary with iac-minion (even though iac-minion is not consulted, it is the primary agent being modified)
5. Write your complete revised meta-plan to `/var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-pK8eRN/opus-model-ai-modeling-roster/phase1-metaplan-rerun.md`
