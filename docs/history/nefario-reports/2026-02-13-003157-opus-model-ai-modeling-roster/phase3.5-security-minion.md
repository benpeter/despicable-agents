APPROVE

No security concerns identified within my domain. This plan modifies agent specifications (the-plan.md), documentation, and a CLAUDE.md template. No attack surface, authentication, secrets, user input handling, or infrastructure changes are involved. The changes are to specification text and project documentation only.

The CLAUDE.md template (Task 5) is user-facing configuration guidance, not executable code. The template examples appropriately avoid including credentials or sensitive data patterns and document that this is a publishable Apache 2.0 project.

Agent specification changes (Tasks 1-3) and delegation table updates (Task 4) do not introduce security-relevant behavior -- these are domain knowledge expansions for deployment strategy selection.

No security review blockers or advisories.
