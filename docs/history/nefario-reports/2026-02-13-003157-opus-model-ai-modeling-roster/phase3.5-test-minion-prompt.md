You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-pK8eRN/opus-model-ai-modeling-roster/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage and verification strategy: Are the verification steps (listed at the end of the plan) sufficient to validate the changes? Are there testable properties of the spec changes that should be verified? Does the cross-check phase of /despicable-lab provide adequate validation for the agent rebuilds? Are there integration-level concerns (e.g., iac-minion and edge-minion boundary correctness) that need specific verification?
