# Phase 8 Documentation Checklist

## Evaluation

| Outcome | Action | Owner | Priority | Status |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Spec/config files modified (the-plan.md) | Scan for derivative docs referencing changed sections | software-docs-minion | COULD | Already done (Task 6) |
| Gate-approved decision (deployment strategy, complexity budget) | ADR | software-docs-minion | MUST | Not needed — decisions are documented in execution report |
| New user-facing template (claudemd-template.md) | Getting-started / how-to | user-docs-minion | SHOULD | Template IS the user doc |

## Assessment

All documentation needs are already satisfied:
- Task 6 (docs staleness check) updated agent-catalog.md and architecture.md
- docs/claudemd-template.md IS the user-facing documentation
- Gate decisions will be documented in the execution report
- No new CLI commands, API endpoints, or breaking changes

**Checklist is empty — skip Phase 8.**
