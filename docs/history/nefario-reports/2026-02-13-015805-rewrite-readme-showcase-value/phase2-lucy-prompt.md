You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet — you are providing your domain expertise
to help build a comprehensive plan.

## Project Task
Rewrite README to showcase what despicable-agents uniquely provides

**Outcome**: The README clearly communicates what despicable-agents gives you that simpler agent setups don't, so that someone evaluating the project understands its value proposition within 60 seconds of reading.

**Success criteria**:
- No inaccuracies introduced — all claims match current codebase capabilities
- All existing README sections are reviewed and updated where they undersell or fail to differentiate the system
- README remains scannable (bullet-based, no walls of text)

## Your Planning Question
Review the current README against the project's actual agent specs and orchestration design. What claims need tightening for accuracy? What governance capabilities (lucy, margo review gates, mandatory reviewers) are undersold or missing? Does the README accurately convey the system's intent and design philosophy as defined in CLAUDE.md and the-plan.md?

## Context
Read the following files:
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/README.md (current README)
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/CLAUDE.md (project instructions)
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/the-plan.md (canonical spec — read at least the top-level structure, governance agents, and design philosophy sections)
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/architecture.md

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand the current state
2. Apply your domain expertise to the planning question
3. Identify risks, dependencies, and requirements from your perspective
4. If you believe additional specialists should be involved that aren't already part of the planning, say so and explain why
5. Return your contribution in this format:

## Domain Plan Contribution: lucy

### Recommendations
<your expert recommendations for this aspect of the task>

### Proposed Tasks
<specific tasks that should be in the execution plan>
For each task: what to do, deliverables, dependencies

### Risks and Concerns
<things that could go wrong from your domain perspective>

### Additional Agents Needed
<any specialists not yet involved who should be, and why>
(or "None" if the current team is sufficient)
