You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet — you are providing your domain expertise
to help build a comprehensive plan.

## Project Task
Rewrite README to showcase what despicable-agents uniquely provides

**Outcome**: The README clearly communicates what despicable-agents gives you that simpler agent setups don't, so that someone evaluating the project understands its value proposition within 60 seconds of reading.

**Success criteria**:
- No inaccuracies introduced — all claims match current codebase capabilities
- README remains scannable (bullet-based, no walls of text)

## Your Planning Question
Verify current README claims against actual codebase capabilities. Identify inaccuracies, recommend where language should be more concrete and user-oriented, and calibrate what belongs in README vs. linked docs.

## Context
Read the following files:
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/README.md (current README)
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/using-nefario.md
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/agent-catalog.md
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/architecture.md
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/external-skills.md
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/install.sh (verify install claims)

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand the current state
2. Apply your domain expertise to the planning question
3. Identify risks, dependencies, and requirements from your perspective
4. If you believe additional specialists should be involved that aren't already part of the planning, say so and explain why
5. Return your contribution in this format:

## Domain Plan Contribution: user-docs-minion

For each task: what to do, deliverables, dependencies

### Risks and Concerns
<things that could go wrong from your domain perspective>

### Additional Agents Needed
<any specialists not yet involved who should be, and why>
(or "None" if the current team is sufficient)
