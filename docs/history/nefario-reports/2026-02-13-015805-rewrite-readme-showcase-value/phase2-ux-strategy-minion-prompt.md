You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet — you are providing your domain expertise
to help build a comprehensive plan.

## Project Task
Rewrite README to showcase what despicable-agents uniquely provides

**Outcome**: The README clearly communicates what despicable-agents gives you that simpler agent setups don't, so that someone evaluating the project understands its value proposition within 60 seconds of reading.

**Success criteria**:
- README contains a "What You Get" section before Examples that covers the structure draft
- Examples section is updated to demonstrate capabilities that justify multi-agent orchestration
- All existing README sections are reviewed and updated where they undersell or fail to differentiate the system
- README remains scannable (bullet-based, no walls of text)

## Your Planning Question
Map the current README's information journey from a first-time evaluator's perspective. Evaluate whether the 60-second scan target is achievable, propose section ordering for progressive disclosure, and flag cognitive load issues.

## Context
Read the following files:
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/README.md (current README — the artifact being improved)

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand the current state
2. Apply your domain expertise to the planning question
3. Identify risks, dependencies, and requirements from your perspective
4. If you believe additional specialists should be involved that aren't already part of the planning, say so and explain why
5. Return your contribution in this format:
