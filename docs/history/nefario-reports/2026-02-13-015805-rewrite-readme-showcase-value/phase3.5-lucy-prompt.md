You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-9dwM0U/rewrite-readme-showcase-value/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Intent alignment, repo conventions, consistency: Does the plan accurately reflect the user's intent (rewrite README to showcase value proposition)? Does the task prompt enforce correctness against canonical sources? Are the proposed section changes consistent with project conventions (CLAUDE.md, the-plan.md)? Is the accuracy requirement strong enough to prevent drift?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
