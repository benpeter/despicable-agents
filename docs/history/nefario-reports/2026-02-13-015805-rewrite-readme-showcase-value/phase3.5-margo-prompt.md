You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-9dwM0U/rewrite-readme-showcase-value/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Simplicity, YAGNI, KISS: Is the plan over-engineered for a README rewrite? Is the task prompt too prescriptive (risking a mechanical, by-the-numbers output)? Are there unnecessary additions being introduced? Is the 120-150 line target appropriate or does it risk bloat?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-9dwM0U/rewrite-readme-showcase-value/phase3.5-margo.md
