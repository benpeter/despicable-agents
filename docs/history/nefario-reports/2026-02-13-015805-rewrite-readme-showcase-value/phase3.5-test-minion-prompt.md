You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-9dwM0U/rewrite-readme-showcase-value/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage: Does the plan account for testing the changes? For a README rewrite, this means: are there verification steps for accuracy of claims? Is there a plan for validating that all links work? Is the success criteria testable?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
