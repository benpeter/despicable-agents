You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-6Op9Al/add-despicable-statusline-docs/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence and intent alignment: Does the plan match the user's stated intent (document /despicable-statusline in project docs)? Does it follow the repo's CLAUDE.md conventions (English artifacts, no framework bloat, YAGNI)? Does it stay within scope (no changes to SKILL.md itself, no statusline styling)?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
