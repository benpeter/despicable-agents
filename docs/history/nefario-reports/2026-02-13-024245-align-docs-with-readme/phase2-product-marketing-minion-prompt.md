You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet — you are providing your domain expertise to help build a comprehensive plan.

## Project Task

Align docs/ files with new progressive-disclosure README. Fix 4 MUST findings and evaluate 2 SHOULD findings across decisions.md, orchestration.md, and architecture.md. All findings relate to stale reviewer counts ("6 ALWAYS reviewers" is now 5 after ux-strategy-minion moved to discretionary pool).

## Your Planning Question

The README rewrite (PR #58) introduced specific terminology: "five mandatory reviewers", "discretionary reviewers", progressive disclosure framing. Beyond the numerical count fixes in the six findings, are there terminology or framing inconsistencies in docs/decisions.md, docs/orchestration.md, and docs/architecture.md that should be addressed while touching them? For example:
- Does the docs/ layer use "ALWAYS" where the README uses "mandatory"?
- Does the docs/ layer use "conditional" where the README uses "discretionary"?
- Are there framing differences that create cognitive dissonance for readers who read both the README and the docs?

Note: The scope is limited to the three target files. We are NOT rewriting these docs — just fixing inconsistencies identified by the Phase 8 audit and any additional terminology drift you find.

## Context

Read the current README.md to understand the terminology baseline. Then read the three target files (docs/decisions.md, docs/orchestration.md, docs/architecture.md) for terminology comparison.

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand the current state
2. Apply your domain expertise to the planning question
3. Identify risks, dependencies, and requirements from your perspective
4. If you believe additional specialists should be involved that aren't already part of the planning, say so and explain why
5. Return your contribution in this format:
