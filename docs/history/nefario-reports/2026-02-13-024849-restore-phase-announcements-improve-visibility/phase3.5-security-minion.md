APPROVE

This is a documentation formatting task with no security implications. The plan modifies markdown files (SKILL.md and docs/*.md) to improve visibility of orchestration messages and standardize file reference formats. No code execution, no user input processing, no authentication, no data storage, no attack surface.

The changes are purely presentational (phase announcement format, blockquote styling, file reference labels). All modifications are to static documentation that defines nefario's orchestration protocol.

No security concerns identified.
