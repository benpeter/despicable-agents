You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-3zAK10/show-phase-task-in-status-and-gates/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI, dependency bloat, unnecessary complexity. Is this plan doing more than needed? Are there simpler approaches? Is the task decomposition appropriate or over-decomposed?

## Context
- Read the project CLAUDE.md at /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/CLAUDE.md for engineering philosophy
- The task is: add phase context to status file writes and gate headers in SKILL.md, plus 3 small doc edits

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: list specific non-blocking warnings
- BLOCK: describe the blocking issue and what must change

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-3zAK10/show-phase-task-in-status-and-gates/phase3.5-margo.md
