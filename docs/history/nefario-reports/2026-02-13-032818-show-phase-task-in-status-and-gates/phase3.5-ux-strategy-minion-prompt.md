You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-3zAK10/show-phase-task-in-status-and-gates/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Orientation experience coherence: Does the plan create a consistent "where am I?" experience across both the status line and gate UI? Are there gaps where the user loses orientation? Is the information density appropriate for each touchpoint?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: list specific non-blocking warnings
- BLOCK: describe the blocking issue and what must change

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
