The dual-channel orientation model (status line + gate headers) is coherent and well-designed. Information density is appropriate for each touchpoint. The plan successfully closes the "where am I?" gap during active orchestration.

Minor observation (non-blocking): For users returning to interrupted sessions mid-execution, orientation requires triangulating header + status line + question field. Current design is acceptable - the task title appears in both the question field and the status file update. Consider for future iteration: including task number in the mid-execution status file format (e.g., "P4 Gate T3 | <title>") to consolidate orientation into the status line touchpoint, but this is not necessary for the current scope.

The cognitive load management is sound (progressive disclosure via P<N> callbacks), character budgets respect constraints without sacrificing recognizability, and the plan correctly optimizes for satisficing (scannable orientation cues) over exhaustive detail.
