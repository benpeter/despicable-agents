# Documentation Impact Checklist

Source: Phase 3.5 architecture review
Plan: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h34Soi/alembic-nefario-status-prefix/phase3-synthesis.md

## Items

- [x] **[software-docs]** Update status line example with alembic prefix
  Scope: Line 191 status line example shows text-variant alembic before phase indicator
  Files: /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/docs/using-nefario.md
  Priority: MUST
  Note: Already covered by Task 2 in the delegation plan

## Summary

The plan already includes comprehensive documentation coverage through Task 2. The only user-facing documentation file requiring updates is `docs/using-nefario.md`, which is explicitly included in the task list. No additional documentation work is needed beyond what the plan already specifies.

The SKILL.md changes in Task 1 are implementation documentation (technical specification of the nefario skill), not user-facing docs, so they do not require separate documentation checklist items.
