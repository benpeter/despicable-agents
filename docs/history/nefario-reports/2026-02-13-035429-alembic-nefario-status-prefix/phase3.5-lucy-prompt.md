You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h34Soi/alembic-nefario-status-prefix/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, intent drift. Does the plan match the user's original intent? Are the changes consistent with project conventions? Does the plan avoid modifying the-plan.md?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
