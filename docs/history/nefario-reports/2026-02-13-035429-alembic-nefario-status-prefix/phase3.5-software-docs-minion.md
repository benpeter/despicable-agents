# Phase 3.5 Review: software-docs-minion

## Verdict

APPROVE

## Rationale

The delegation plan has adequate documentation coverage. Task 2 explicitly handles the only user-facing documentation file that requires updating (`docs/using-nefario.md` line 191). The task prompt is precise and includes the exact change needed (adding the text-variant alembic prefix to the status line example).

No additional documentation gaps exist. Task 1 modifies SKILL.md, which is implementation documentation (specification for the nefario skill itself), not user-facing developer documentation. The SKILL.md changes are self-documenting through the inline comment explaining the encoding.

The plan correctly identified and scoped the documentation impact during Phase 2 consultation with software-docs-minion, and Task 2 fully addresses that scope.
