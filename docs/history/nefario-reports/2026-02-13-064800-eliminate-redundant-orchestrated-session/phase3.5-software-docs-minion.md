# Phase 3.5 Review: software-docs-minion

## Verdict
**APPROVE**

## Rationale

The plan has adequate documentation coverage. The only doc impact is:
- Single paragraph replacement in `docs/commit-workflow.md` line 259
- Already captured as Edit 5 in Task 1 prompt
- Exact replacement text provided

No additional documentation work needed for Phase 8. The change is narrow (replacing one suppression mechanism with another), well-scoped, and the task prompt contains complete before/after text.

No user-facing docs impact. No API docs impact. No architecture docs impact beyond the single paragraph edit already included in the task.

## Checklist Status
1 item identified, already covered in Task 1. No gaps.
