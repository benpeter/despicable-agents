## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, intent drift. Check that:

- The changes respect the project's conventions (English artifacts, Helix Manifesto, YAGNI/KISS)
- The scope boundaries (in/out) from the issue are respected
- The Visual Hierarchy table update is consistent with the template changes
- No unintended side effects or scope creep
