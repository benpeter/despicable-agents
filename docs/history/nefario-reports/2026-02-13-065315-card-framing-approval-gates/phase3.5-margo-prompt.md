You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI, dependency bloat. Check that:
- The plan is the minimum viable change to achieve the success criteria
- No unnecessary complexity or abstractions are introduced
- The 52-character border width is justified (not arbitrarily complex)
- The scope stays within what was asked -- no gold plating
- No unnecessary dependencies or tools are introduced

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase3.5-margo.md
