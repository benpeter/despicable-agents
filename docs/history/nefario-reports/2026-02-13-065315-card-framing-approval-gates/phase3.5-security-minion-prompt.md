You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Security gaps. The plan modifies a single documentation/template file (SKILL.md) with formatting changes (backtick wrapping, box-drawing characters). No code, no user input, no APIs, no auth, no infrastructure. Check if there are any security concerns with the proposed changes.

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase3.5-security-minion.md
