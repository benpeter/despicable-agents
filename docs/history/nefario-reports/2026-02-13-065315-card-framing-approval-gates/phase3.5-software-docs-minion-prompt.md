# Documentation Impact Checklist

Source: Phase 3.5 architecture review
Plan: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase3-synthesis.md

## Items

- [ ] **[software-docs]** <what to update>
  Scope: <what specifically changes, one line>
  Files: <exact file path(s) affected>
  Priority: MUST | SHOULD | COULD

- [ ] **[user-docs]** <what to update>
  Scope: <what specifically changes, one line>
  Files: <exact file path(s) affected>
  Priority: MUST | SHOULD | COULD
```

Rules:
- Owner tag: [software-docs] or [user-docs] to pre-route to Phase 8 agent
- One line per item for the description
- Scope: one line of intent, not a paragraph
- Priority: MUST (required for correctness), SHOULD (improves completeness),
  COULD (nice to have)
- Max 10 items

## Verdict
After writing the checklist, return your verdict:
- APPROVE: Plan has adequate documentation coverage in its task prompts
- ADVISE: Documentation gaps exist but are addressable in Phase 8
- Do NOT use BLOCK for documentation concerns.

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase3.5-software-docs-minion.md

Be concise. Focus on identifying WHAT needs documenting, not writing docs.
