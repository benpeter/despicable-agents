# Software Docs Review: card-framing-approval-gates

## Verdict
**APPROVE**

## Rationale
The plan has adequate documentation coverage. This is a self-contained visual formatting change to the APPROVAL GATE template in SKILL.md with no broader documentation impact.

### Documentation completeness
- The only affected documentation is SKILL.md itself, which is the file being modified
- The Visual Hierarchy table update documents the new pattern directly in the skill file
- No architecture docs, ADRs, README, or onboarding materials require updates

### Why no additional documentation is needed
1. **No architectural change**: Visual formatting refinement to existing approval gate pattern. C4 diagrams unchanged.
2. **No API contract change**: Template fields and semantics unchanged. Only presentation changes.
3. **No onboarding impact**: Getting-started docs don't cover approval gate formatting details. Pattern is learned through usage.
4. **Self-documenting**: The updated Visual Hierarchy table in SKILL.md serves as the single source of truth for the new pattern.

### Phase 8 documentation checklist
One item identified:
- MUST: Update SKILL.md template and Visual Hierarchy table (this is the execution task itself, not additional documentation)

No follow-up documentation work required beyond the planned SKILL.md edits.
