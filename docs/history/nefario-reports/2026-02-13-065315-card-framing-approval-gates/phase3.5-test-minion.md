# Test-Minion Review: card-framing-approval-gates

## Verdict: APPROVE

This change modifies only documentation/template formatting in SKILL.md. No executable code, no runtime behavior, no testable functionality is affected.

The changes are:
1. Visual formatting of a template (APPROVAL GATE)
2. Documentation table update (Visual Hierarchy)

No test coverage considerations apply. Manual verification steps in the plan are appropriate for template formatting validation.
