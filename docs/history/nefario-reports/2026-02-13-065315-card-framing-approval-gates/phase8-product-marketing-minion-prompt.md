## Execution Summary
The APPROVAL GATE template in skills/nefario/SKILL.md was updated to use backtick-wrapped
box-drawing dash borders and backtick-wrapped field labels, creating card-like visual
separation in Claude Code terminal output. The Visual Hierarchy table was also updated.

## Current README
Read: /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/2/README.md

## Your Task
Classify each user-visible change into a tier:
- Tier 1: Headline Feature (new capability, changes mental model)
- Tier 2: Notable Enhancement (improves existing capability, user notices)
- Tier 3: Document Only (internal improvement, user experience unchanged)

For each change return:
- Change description (one line)
- Tier classification with rationale (one sentence)
- Recommendation per tier action column
