You are reviewing documentation produced during an orchestrated execution.

## Work Order
Read the checklist: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase8-checklist.md

## Items tagged [software-docs]
The only item is already completed (SKILL.md was the deliverable itself).

## Your Task
Review the changes made to skills/nefario/SKILL.md to confirm:
1. The updated APPROVAL GATE template is consistent with the rest of the document
2. The Visual Hierarchy table accurately describes the new pattern
3. No other documentation in the repo needs updating as a result

Check these files for potential impact:
- docs/architecture.md
- README.md or CLAUDE.md
- Any other files referencing the approval gate format

Write your findings to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase8-software-docs.md
