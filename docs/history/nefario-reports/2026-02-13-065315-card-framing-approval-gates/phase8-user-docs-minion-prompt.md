You are reviewing documentation produced during an orchestrated execution.

## Work Order
Read the checklist: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase8-checklist.md

## Items tagged [user-docs]
No items tagged [user-docs] in the checklist.

## Your Task
Review the changes made to skills/nefario/SKILL.md (approval gate template formatting) and determine if any user-facing documentation needs updating. This is an internal visual formatting change to how approval gates appear in Claude Code terminal output.

Consider:
1. Is there any getting-started or how-to documentation that references approval gate format?
2. Are there any user guides that show approval gate examples?
3. Does the README mention gate formatting?

Write your findings to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mq2F9b/card-framing-approval-gates/phase8-user-docs.md
