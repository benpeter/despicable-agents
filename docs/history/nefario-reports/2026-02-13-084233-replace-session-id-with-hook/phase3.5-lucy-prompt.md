You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1ytDH0/replace-session-id-with-hook/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Governance review: Does this plan align with the project's CLAUDE.md conventions (English artifacts, no PII, Helix Manifesto principles)? Does it respect agent boundaries (Does NOT do sections)? Does the plan drift from the original task intent? Does it introduce inconsistencies with existing patterns in the codebase?

Check the project's CLAUDE.md at /Users/ben/github/benpeter/despicable-agents/CLAUDE.md for conventions.

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
