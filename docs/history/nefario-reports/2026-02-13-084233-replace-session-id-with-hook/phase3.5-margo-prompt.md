You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1ytDH0/replace-session-id-with-hook/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Simplicity review: Is this plan over-engineered? Does it add unnecessary complexity, dependencies, or abstractions? Does it follow YAGNI and KISS? Are there simpler approaches that would achieve the same outcome? Is the scope appropriate or is it doing more than asked?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
