You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1ytDH0/replace-session-id-with-hook/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage: Does this change introduce any testable behavior? Are the verification steps adequate? Should any automated tests be added? Consider that the changes are to YAML frontmatter and markdown instruction files, not executable code. The "test" is whether the env var is available at runtime, which requires a live Claude Code session.

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
