APPROVE

This plan modifies documentation and configuration files only. No security concerns:

- No code execution paths introduced
- No authentication or authorization changes
- No user input handling
- No secrets management changes
- No dependency modifications
- No API or network surface changes
- No data flow modifications

The change promotes ux-strategy-minion to mandatory reviewer status and removes software-docs-minion from Phase 3.5, affecting only the orchestration logic for future reviews. This is a process change with no security implications.
