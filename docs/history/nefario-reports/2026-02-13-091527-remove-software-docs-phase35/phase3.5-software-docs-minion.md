# software-docs-minion Review

## Verdict

**APPROVE**

## Rationale

The plan modifies four documentation/configuration files (the-plan.md, SKILL.md, AGENT.md, orchestration.md) to reflect the Phase 3.5 reviewer change and Phase 8 simplification. These changes are self-documenting.

An ADR documenting this architectural decision would provide historical context but is not strictly required for correctness. The decision rationale is already captured in the synthesis document and user task description. Marked as SHOULD priority in the Phase 8 checklist.

No gaps in documentation coverage.
