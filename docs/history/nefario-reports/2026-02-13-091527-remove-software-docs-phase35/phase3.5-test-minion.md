APPROVE

This plan produces no executable code. All tasks modify documentation and configuration files (the-plan.md, SKILL.md, AGENT.md, orchestration.md). No test coverage required.

The change itself is meta-level: adjusting which agents review delegation plans. The review mechanism's correctness will be validated through actual orchestration runs, not unit/integration tests.
