You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet — you are providing your domain expertise
to help build a comprehensive plan.

## Project Task

Polish approval gate presentation in skills/nefario/SKILL.md:
1. Apply backtick card framing to 4 remaining gates (Team, Reviewer, Execution Plan, PR) — matching the pattern already applied to the mid-execution gate
2. Add markdown links to scratch files in all 5 gates (team, reviewer, exec plan, mid-execution, PR)
3. Shorten scratch dir display (slug-only display text, full path as link target)
4. Add prompt+verdict links in advisory sections
5. Make links visually distinct

## Your Planning Question

Given that approval gates are the highest-attention UI element in the orchestration workflow (Decision weight in the Visual Hierarchy), how should scratch file links be integrated without diluting the decision-making focus? Specifically:
(a) Where in the gate template should links appear — inline with advisories, in a footer section, or both?
(b) What display text convention makes links scannable without adding visual noise?
(c) For the four simpler gates (Team, Reviewer, Execution Plan, PR) that have fewer scratch files than mid-execution gates, what is the minimum viable link set?
Consider cognitive load: gates are interruptions where users need to decide, not explore.

## Context

Read the following files to understand the current gate templates and visual hierarchy:
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/3/skills/nefario/SKILL.md — the full orchestration skill file containing all gate templates and the Visual Hierarchy table

Focus specifically on:
- The Visual Hierarchy table (search for "Visual Hierarchy")
- The Team Approval Gate template (search for "Team Approval Gate")
- The Reviewer Approval Gate template (search for "Reviewer Approval Gate")
- The Execution Plan Approval Gate / "Plan Presentation Format" section
- The mid-execution approval gate template (already has card framing)
- The PR Gate template (search for "PR creation" near Phase 4 wrap-up)
- The ADVISORIES format in the Execution Plan section

## Instructions
1. Read the SKILL.md to understand the current gate templates
2. Apply your domain expertise to the planning question
3. Identify risks, dependencies, and requirements from your perspective
