You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-ICWV4u/approval-gate-polish/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI violations, unnecessary complexity, and dependency bloat. Specifically:
- Is the plan doing more than necessary to solve issues #82 and #85?
- Are any of the sub-tasks unnecessary or adding complexity without clear value?
- Is the role-label vocabulary table (5 entries) over-designed for the actual need?
- Are there simpler approaches that achieve the same goals?
- Does the plan introduce any unnecessary abstractions or patterns?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-ICWV4u/approval-gate-polish/phase3.5-margo.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
