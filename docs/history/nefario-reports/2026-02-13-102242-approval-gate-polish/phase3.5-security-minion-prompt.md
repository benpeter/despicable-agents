You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-ICWV4u/approval-gate-polish/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Security gaps: injection vectors, secret exposure, auth/authz issues, path traversal, supply chain risks, or any security-relevant concerns in the planned changes.

Note: This plan modifies markdown templates in a SKILL.md file (documentation/instructions). There is no executable code, no user input handling, no auth, no secrets, and no dependencies being changed. Focus your review on whether the planned changes could introduce security risks in how the templates are processed or rendered.

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-ICWV4u/approval-gate-polish/phase3.5-security-minion.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
