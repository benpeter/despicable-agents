You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-ICWV4u/approval-gate-polish/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage and test strategy: Does the plan need tests? Are there testable assertions? Is the testing strategy (or lack thereof) appropriate for the scope of changes?

Note: This plan modifies markdown templates in a SKILL.md file. These are instructional templates, not executable code. The synthesis explicitly notes testing is not applicable. Evaluate whether this assessment is correct.

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-ICWV4u/approval-gate-polish/phase3.5-test-minion.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
