APPROVE

The synthesis correctly identifies that testing is not applicable for this change. These are markdown templates in a SKILL.md file, not executable code. The templates are instructional patterns for nefario's output generation.

The verification steps (lines 368-378) provide appropriate quality assurance through manual inspection of template structure, link format, and scope boundaries. This is the correct validation approach for documentation templates.

No test coverage concerns from my domain.
