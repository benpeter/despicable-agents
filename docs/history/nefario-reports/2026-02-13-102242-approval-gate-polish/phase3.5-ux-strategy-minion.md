No concerns from the UX strategy domain. The plan reduces cognitive load through visual consistency and progressive disclosure, creates journey coherence across all gate types, serves real user information needs without feature creep, and is already simplified to essentials. The conflict resolution rationale demonstrates sound application of Don Norman principles (visibility, affordances, mapping) and Krug's "don't make me think" heuristic.
