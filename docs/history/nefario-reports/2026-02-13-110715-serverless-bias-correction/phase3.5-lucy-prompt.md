You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h3BN8s/serverless-bias-correction/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention and intent alignment review:
- Does the synthesis faithfully represent the user's original question about serverless bias?
- Are the recommended entry points (CLAUDE.md, agent specs, delegation table) consistent with the project's existing conventions?
- Does the plan respect the publishability constraint (Apache 2.0, no vendor opinions baked in)?
- Is there goal drift -- does the advisory answer the question that was asked, or has it expanded scope?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h3BN8s/serverless-bias-correction/phase3.5-lucy.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
