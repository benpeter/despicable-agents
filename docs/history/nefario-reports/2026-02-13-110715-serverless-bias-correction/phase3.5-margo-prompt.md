You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h3BN8s/serverless-bias-correction/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Simplicity and YAGNI review of the proposed changes:
- Are any of the recommended changes over-engineered?
- Is the 5-level escalation path too complex? Could it be simpler?
- Does the advisory introduce unnecessary abstractions or frameworks?
- Are there recommendations that could be consolidated or dropped?
- Is the implementation roadmap appropriately scoped or does it expand beyond what was asked?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h3BN8s/serverless-bias-correction/phase3.5-margo.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
