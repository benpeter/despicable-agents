You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h3BN8s/serverless-bias-correction/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Security implications of the serverless bias correction advisory. Consider:
- Does the advisory adequately address the security implications of serverless-first defaults?
- Serverless security model (shared responsibility, function-level permissions, secrets management)
- Vendor lock-in as a security consideration
- Are there security anti-patterns that could emerge from a "serverless-first" default?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h3BN8s/serverless-bias-correction/phase3.5-security-minion.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
