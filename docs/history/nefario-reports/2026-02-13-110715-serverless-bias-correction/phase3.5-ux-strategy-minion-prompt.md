You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: evaluate journey coherence, cognitive load, and simplification
opportunities across the plan.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h3BN8s/serverless-bias-correction/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
1. Journey coherence: Do the recommended changes form a coherent experience for developers using the agent system? Is the escalation path intuitive?
2. Cognitive load: Will the changes simplify or complicate the developer's decision-making when choosing a deployment strategy?
3. Simplification: Can any recommended changes be combined or simplified?
4. User jobs-to-be-done: Does each recommendation serve a real developer need?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-h3BN8s/serverless-bias-correction/phase3.5-ux-strategy-minion.md
