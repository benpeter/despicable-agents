Advisory-only request. Create a meaningful report with the team to consult on the following question, don't act. No execution or post-processing. Use opus for all agents involved.

Question: When starting greenfield, the system thinks serverless is complicated and flags it as overengineering / YAGNI / anti-KISS, but that's a wrong bias. Serverless is super simple.
