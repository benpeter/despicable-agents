You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet -- you are providing your domain expertise
to help build a comprehensive recommendation.

## Project Task

Propose description, website, and topics for the GitHub "About" section of the despicable-agents repo. The About section is currently completely empty.

## Your Planning Question

Does the proposed About section content align with the project's established identity, conventions, and CLAUDE.md? Specifically: (1) Is the description consistent with how the project describes itself in CLAUDE.md, README, and the-plan.md? (2) Do proposed topics accurately reflect what the project IS (not aspirational features)? (3) Does the overall tone match the project's existing voice -- which balances technical precision with the playful Despicable Me naming? (4) Are there any contradictions between the About section content and the project's stated design principles (generic, publishable, composable, persistent learners)?

## Context

- Repo: https://github.com/benpeter/despicable-agents
- CLAUDE.md describes: "Specialist agent team for Claude Code. 27 agents organized as Gru (boss), Nefario (orchestrator), Lucy and Margo (governance), and 23 domain-specialist minions."
- Design principles from the-plan.md: generic domain specialists, publishable, composable, persistent learners
- Engineering philosophy: Helix Manifesto -- YAGNI, KISS, lean and mean
- License: Apache 2.0
- Key rule: "No PII, no proprietary data -- agents must remain publishable"

## Advisory Context

This is an advisory-only orchestration. Your contribution will feed into a team recommendation, not an execution plan. Focus on analysis, trade-offs, and recommendations rather than implementation tasks.

## Instructions

1. Read CLAUDE.md, README.md, and the-plan.md to understand the project's self-description
2. Evaluate consistency between the project's internal and external identity
3. Flag any potential contradictions or misalignments
4. Recommend how the About section should reflect the project's established voice
5. Return your contribution in this format:
