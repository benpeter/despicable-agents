You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet -- you are providing your domain expertise
to help build a comprehensive recommendation.

## Project Task

Propose description, website, and topics for the GitHub "About" section of the despicable-agents repo. The About section is currently completely empty.

## Your Planning Question

Given that despicable-agents is an open-source (Apache 2.0) specialist agent framework for Claude Code with 27 agents, phased orchestration, and built-in governance -- what description (max ~350 chars) best communicates the value proposition to developers discovering the repo on GitHub? Consider: what makes this different from other AI agent frameworks? What keywords should appear in the description for scanning readability? Should the tone lean technical/functional or slightly playful (given the Despicable Me naming)?

## Context

- Repo: https://github.com/benpeter/despicable-agents
- License: Apache 2.0, Primary language: Shell
- README tagline: "Structured orchestration, domain specialists, and governance gates for Claude Code. Built on Agent Teams. 27 agents, 2 skills, available in every session after a one-time install."
- Key differentiators from README "What You Get":
  1. Phased orchestration -- nine structured phases from meta-planning through parallel execution to post-execution verification
  2. Research-backed domain experts -- 27 agents built from domain research, each with strict boundaries
  3. Built-in governance and quality gates -- five mandatory reviewers examine every plan before code runs
  4. Goodies -- execution reports, /despicable-prompter skill, install once available everywhere
- Agent roster: gru (AI visionary), nefario (orchestrator), lucy & margo (governance), 23 domain-specialist minions
- Design principles from the-plan.md: generic domain specialists, publishable, composable, persistent learners
- Engineering philosophy: follows Helix Manifesto -- YAGNI, KISS, lean and mean

## Advisory Context

This is an advisory-only orchestration. Your contribution will feed into a team recommendation, not an execution plan. Focus on analysis, trade-offs, and recommendations rather than implementation tasks.

## Instructions

1. Read the README.md and docs/architecture.md to understand current project positioning
2. Apply your domain expertise to the planning question
3. Propose 2-3 candidate descriptions with trade-off analysis
4. Recommend a website URL strategy (link to README? docs? leave blank?)
5. Identify risks and concerns from your perspective
6. Return your contribution in this format:

## Domain Plan Contribution: product-marketing-minion

### Recommendations
<your expert recommendations>

### Proposed Tasks
