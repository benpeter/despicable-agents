You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet -- you are providing your domain expertise
to help build a comprehensive recommendation.

## Project Task

Propose description, website, and topics for the GitHub "About" section of the despicable-agents repo. The About section is currently completely empty.

## Your Planning Question

What GitHub topics maximize discoverability for this repo? Consider: (1) what terms developers search when looking for Claude Code extensions, AI agent frameworks, or multi-agent orchestration tools; (2) which existing GitHub topic ecosystems have active communities (e.g., `claude`, `anthropic`, `ai-agents`, `llm`); (3) the balance between broad topics (high traffic, low signal) and specific topics (low traffic, high relevance); (4) GitHub's topic limit and best practices for topic count. Research what topics competing/related repos use (e.g., claude-code tools, MCP servers, AI agent frameworks).

## Context

- Repo: https://github.com/benpeter/despicable-agents
- License: Apache 2.0, Primary language: Shell
- Core technology: Claude Code, Agent Teams, specialist agents
- Domain terms: multi-agent orchestration, domain specialists, governance gates, phased orchestration
- Key associations: Anthropic, Claude, Claude Code, MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- The project is NOT a framework/library -- it's a set of deployable agents and skills
- Install method: symlinks to ~/.claude/ directory

## Advisory Context

This is an advisory-only orchestration. Your contribution will feed into a team recommendation, not an execution plan. Focus on analysis, trade-offs, and recommendations rather than implementation tasks.

## Instructions

1. Research GitHub topic ecosystems relevant to this project
2. Analyze what topics similar repos (claude-code extensions, AI agent frameworks) use
3. Propose a curated topic list with rationale for each topic
4. Consider topic count best practices (GitHub recommends up to 20, but most effective repos use 5-15)
5. Identify risks and concerns from your perspective
6. Return your contribution in this format:
