You are contributing to the PLANNING phase of a multi-agent project.
You are NOT executing yet -- you are providing your domain expertise
to help build a comprehensive recommendation.

## Project Task

Propose description, website, and topics for the GitHub "About" section of the despicable-agents repo. The About section is currently completely empty.

## Your Planning Question

From a user journey perspective, a developer lands on this GitHub repo page and sees the About section first. What information hierarchy best serves the "should I care about this?" decision in 3 seconds? Should the description lead with what it IS (specialist agent team for Claude Code), what it DOES (orchestrated multi-agent execution with governance), or what PROBLEM it solves (complex tasks get decomposed across domain experts)? Does the Despicable Me theming help or hurt first-impression comprehension for developers who have never heard of this project?

## Context

- Repo: https://github.com/benpeter/despicable-agents
- The GitHub About section appears in the right sidebar on the repo page
- Description appears immediately below the repo name in search results and the repo page
- Current README first line: "Structured orchestration, domain specialists, and governance gates for Claude Code. Built on Agent Teams. 27 agents, 2 skills, available in every session after a one-time install."
- Examples from README show usage patterns: @security-minion, @debugger-minion, /nefario, /despicable-prompter
- Install: ./install.sh symlinks everything to ~/.claude/
- Target audience: developers already using Claude Code who want structured multi-agent workflows

## Advisory Context

This is an advisory-only orchestration. Your contribution will feed into a team recommendation, not an execution plan. Focus on analysis, trade-offs, and recommendations rather than implementation tasks.

## Instructions

1. Read the README.md to understand the current first-impression flow
2. Evaluate cognitive load of different description approaches
3. Assess the Despicable Me theming's impact on comprehension
4. Recommend an information hierarchy for the description
5. Identify risks and concerns from your perspective
6. Return your contribution in this format:
