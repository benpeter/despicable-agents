MODE: SYNTHESIS
ADVISORY: true

You are synthesizing specialist planning contributions into a
team recommendation. This is an advisory-only orchestration --
no code will be written, no branches created, no PRs opened.

Do NOT produce task prompts, agent assignments, execution order,
approval gates, or delegation plan structure. Produce an advisory
report using the advisory output format defined in your AGENT.md.

## Original Task

Propose description, website, and topics for the GitHub "About" section of the despicable-agents repo. The About section is currently completely empty.

## Specialist Contributions

Read the following scratch files for full specialist contributions:

## Key consensus across specialists:

- product-marketing-minion: Lead with governance as primary differentiator; fun names, serious descriptions. 299-char description emphasizing 27 agents, phased orchestration, governance gates, mandatory reviewers. Recommends 8 topics. Website: leave blank.
- seo-minion: 10 topics in 3 tiers favoring niche precision over broad reach; target Claude Code users, not general AI community. Excluded `llm`, `claude`, `framework` as too broad/inaccurate. Website: leave blank.
- ux-strategy-minion: Lead with WHAT IT IS for fastest pattern matching; keep description short (~106 chars) so first 100 chars are self-sufficient. Theming is net neutral -- let name carry personality, description carry information. Website: leave blank.
- lucy: Base description on README opening line; verified strong internal consistency across all canonical docs. 5-7 topics from verified-accurate set only; avoid aspirational terms. Website: leave blank.
