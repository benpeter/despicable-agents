You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1zOJ65/gates-include-orchestration-title/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence and consistency: Does the plan maintain consistency with existing SKILL.md conventions? Does the centralized convention note follow the same formatting pattern as the existing `header` constraint note? Does the plan preserve intent alignment with the original issue (every gate gets run context)?

Also check: Does the plan's scope match the issue description? Are there gates the plan misses? Does the plan introduce changes beyond what was requested?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1zOJ65/gates-include-orchestration-title/phase3.5-lucy.md
