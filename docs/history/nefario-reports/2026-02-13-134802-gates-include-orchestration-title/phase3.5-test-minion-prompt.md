You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1zOJ65/gates-include-orchestration-title/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage: The plan modifies a markdown specification file (SKILL.md). No executable code is produced. Are there verification steps that should be added? Is the post-execution verification approach (diff review, structural checks) adequate for a specification-only change?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1zOJ65/gates-include-orchestration-title/phase3.5-test-minion.md
