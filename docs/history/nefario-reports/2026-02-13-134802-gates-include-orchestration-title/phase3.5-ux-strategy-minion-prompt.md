You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: evaluate journey coherence, cognitive load, and simplification
opportunities across the plan.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1zOJ65/gates-include-orchestration-title/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
1. Journey coherence: Does the suffix convention (`\n\nRun: $summary`) create a coherent user experience across all 12 gates? Are there gates where the suffix feels out of place?
2. Cognitive load: Does the trailing run line increase or decrease cognitive load? Is the "Run:" label intuitive?
3. Simplification: The plan chose suffix over your prefix recommendation. Given the rationale (headers and structured cards provide top-of-prompt context), does the suffix approach maintain adequate orientation?
4. Post-exec gate: Does "Post-execution phases for Task N: <task title>?\n\nRun: $summary" adequately solve the zero-context problem?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1zOJ65/gates-include-orchestration-title/phase3.5-ux-strategy-minion.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
