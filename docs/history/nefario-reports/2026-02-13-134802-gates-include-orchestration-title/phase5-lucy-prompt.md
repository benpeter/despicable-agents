You are reviewing code produced during an orchestrated execution.

## Changed Files
- skills/nefario/SKILL.md (+14/-6 lines)

## Execution Context
Read scratch files for context: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-1zOJ65/gates-include-orchestration-title/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, intent drift. Verify:
1. The convention note matches the `> Note:` formatting of adjacent constraints
2. The changes align with the original issue intent (every gate gets run context)
3. No intent drift -- the changes should be purely additive (no existing content removed or restructured)
4. CLAUDE.md compliance -- English language, no PII, no unnecessary changes

## Instructions
