check if we are fine on all platforms and if not, what it would take to be safe on windows, macOS, linux
we should think about adding documentation disclaimers that this is mac-only until we have that fixed (if the answer is "not yet")
also think about documenting all command line tools that are expected to be available
in the report, include prompts for
- the docs disclaimer for platform specificity for now
- documentation on required command line tools and how to install them ("ask claude code to do it for you, just paste the list")
- achieving cross-platform stability
