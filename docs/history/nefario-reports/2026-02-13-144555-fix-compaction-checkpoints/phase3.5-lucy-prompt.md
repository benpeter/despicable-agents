You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-PKILQw/fix-compaction-checkpoints/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, and intent drift. Does the plan follow the established patterns in the codebase? Does it drift from the user's original intent (issue #87)? Are there inconsistencies with existing gates, naming conventions, or the visual hierarchy system?

The original issue proposed clipboard copy via pbcopy. The plan adopts a different approach (printed code block). Check whether this deviation is well-justified or represents intent drift.

Also check: the project CLAUDE.md at /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/3/CLAUDE.md for any relevant conventions.

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: list specific non-blocking warnings
- BLOCK: describe the blocking issue and what must change

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-PKILQw/fix-compaction-checkpoints/phase3.5-lucy.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
