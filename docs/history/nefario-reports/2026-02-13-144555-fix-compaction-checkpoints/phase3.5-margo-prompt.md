You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-PKILQw/fix-compaction-checkpoints/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI violations, dependency bloat, and unnecessary complexity. Is the plan doing more than what's needed? Are there simpler approaches? Does the skip-cascade logic add unnecessary complexity? Are the authoring guard comments necessary?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: list specific non-blocking warnings
- BLOCK: describe the blocking issue and what must change

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-PKILQw/fix-compaction-checkpoints/phase3.5-margo.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
