You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-PKILQw/fix-compaction-checkpoints/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage: Does the plan adequately address testing? The change modifies a markdown spec file (SKILL.md), not executable code. No test infrastructure exists for SKILL.md content. Are there any testable aspects being overlooked?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: list specific non-blocking warnings
- BLOCK: describe the blocking issue and what must change

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-PKILQw/fix-compaction-checkpoints/phase3.5-test-minion.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
