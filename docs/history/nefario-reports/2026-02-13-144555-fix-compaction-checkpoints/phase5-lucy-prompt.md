You are reviewing code produced during an orchestrated execution.

## Changed Files
- `skills/nefario/SKILL.md` (replaced 2 compaction checkpoint sections + visual hierarchy table update)

## Execution Context
Read scratch files for context: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-PKILQw/fix-compaction-checkpoints/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, intent drift. Check that the changes follow established patterns in SKILL.md and CLAUDE.md at /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/3/CLAUDE.md.

Note: The user overruled the skip-cascade feature during the approval gate. The P3.5 checkpoint should now be independent (no reference to P3 state).
