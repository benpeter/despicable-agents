MODE: META-PLAN

You are creating a meta-plan — a plan for who should help plan.

## Task
<github-issue>
**Outcome**: Any roster adjustment at the Team Approval Gate triggers a full Phase 1 re-run, so that all agents' planning questions reflect the updated team composition. Currently, minor adjustments (1-2 changes) use a lightweight path that only generates questions for added agents, leaving existing agents' questions stale relative to the new roster. Since planning questions directly shape Phase 2 specialist focus, coherent questions across the full team produce better planning contributions.

**Success criteria**:
- Minor/substantial adjustment classification is removed from SKILL.md
- Any roster change at the Team Approval Gate triggers a full Phase 1 re-run
- Re-run prompt includes the original task, prior meta-plan, and structured delta (same as current substantial path)
- 1 re-run cap per gate is preserved
- 2 adjustment round cap is preserved
- AGENT.md references to minor/substantial paths are removed or updated

**Scope**:
- In: SKILL.md Team Approval Gate adjustment handling, AGENT.md if it references the minor/substantial distinction
- Out: Phase 1 meta-plan logic itself, other approval gates, Phase 3.5 reviewer adjustment gate

## External Skill Discovery
Before analyzing the task, scan for project-local skills. If skills are
discovered, include an "External Skill Integration" section in your meta-plan
(see your Core Knowledge for the output format).

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand the codebase context
2. Discover external skills:
   a. Scan .claude/skills/ and .skills/ in the working directory for SKILL.md files
   b. Read frontmatter (name, description) for each discovered skill
   c. For skills whose description matches the task domain, classify as
      ORCHESTRATION or LEAF (see External Skill Integration in your Core Knowledge)
   d. Check the project's CLAUDE.md for explicit skill preferences
   e. Include discovered skills in your meta-plan output
3. Analyze the task against your delegation table
4. Identify which specialists should be CONSULTED FOR PLANNING
   (not execution — planning). These are agents whose domain
   expertise is needed to create a good plan.
5. For each specialist, write a specific planning question that
   draws on their unique expertise.
6. Return the meta-plan in the structured format.
7. Write your complete meta-plan to `/var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-mxHO9Q/always-rerun-phase1-on-team-gate-change/phase1-metaplan.md`
