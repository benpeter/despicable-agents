You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mxHO9Q/always-rerun-phase1-on-team-gate-change/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence and intent alignment: Does the plan follow the project's conventions (CLAUDE.md, the-plan.md)? Does each task's scope match the user's original intent (GitHub issue #78)? Are there any goal drift risks -- tasks that go beyond what the issue asked for? Pay particular attention to the deviation from the issue's success criteria regarding the "1 re-run cap per gate" -- is the rationale sound?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mxHO9Q/always-rerun-phase1-on-team-gate-change/phase3.5-lucy.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
