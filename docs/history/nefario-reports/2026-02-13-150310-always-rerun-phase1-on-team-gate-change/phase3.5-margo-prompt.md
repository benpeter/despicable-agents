You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mxHO9Q/always-rerun-phase1-on-team-gate-change/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering and YAGNI: Does the plan introduce unnecessary complexity? Are there tasks that could be simplified or removed? Is the scope appropriately constrained to what the issue asks for, or does it creep into adjacent concerns? Evaluate whether the 3-task structure is the minimum necessary, or if tasks could be consolidated.

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mxHO9Q/always-rerun-phase1-on-team-gate-change/phase3.5-margo.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
