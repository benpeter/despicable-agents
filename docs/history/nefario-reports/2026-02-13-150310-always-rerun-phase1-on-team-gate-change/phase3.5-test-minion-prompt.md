You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mxHO9Q/always-rerun-phase1-on-team-gate-change/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage: The plan produces no executable code -- all deliverables are documentation/spec edits. Evaluate whether the verification steps in the plan are sufficient to catch regressions: grep-based checks for stale terminology, end-to-end read of the updated sections, cross-reference consistency. Are there gaps in the verification strategy?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-mxHO9Q/always-rerun-phase1-on-team-gate-change/phase3.5-test-minion.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
