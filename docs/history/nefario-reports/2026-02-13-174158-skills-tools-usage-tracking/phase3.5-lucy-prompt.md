You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, intent drift: Does the plan align with the project's conventions (CLAUDE.md, TEMPLATE.md patterns, SKILL.md structure)? Does the plan match the original issue intent? Are there any goal drift risks? Does the replacement of External Skills with Session Resources maintain consistency with existing patterns?

- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/3/docs/history/nefario-reports/TEMPLATE.md (current template structure)

- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.

- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3.5-lucy.md
