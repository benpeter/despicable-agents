You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI, dependency bloat: Is the plan doing more than necessary? Are there unnecessary abstractions, premature generalizations, or scope creep? Is the Session Resources section overly complex for the stated goal? Could any of the proposed changes be simplified or eliminated? Does the three-subsection structure (External Skills, Skills Invoked, Tool Usage) add unnecessary complexity?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3.5-margo.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
