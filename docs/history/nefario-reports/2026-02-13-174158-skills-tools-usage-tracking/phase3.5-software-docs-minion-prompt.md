You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Documentation structural consistency: The deliverables are documentation artifacts (TEMPLATE.md and SKILL.md). Review: (1) Are the conditional inclusion rules coherent and non-contradictory? (2) Is the collapsibility pattern correctly applied? (3) Does the Session Resources section structure (parent + 3 subsections) follow consistent formatting with other template sections? (4) Are the instructions for SKILL.md changes (Data Accumulation, Wrap-up Sequence, compaction focus strings) clear and complete? (5) Is the replacement of External Skills cleanly handled with no orphaned references?

Also read the current template for structural context:
- /Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/3/docs/history/nefario-reports/TEMPLATE.md

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3.5-software-docs-minion.md
