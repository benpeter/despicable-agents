You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage and validation: Are the conditional inclusion rules coherent? Are edge cases addressed (empty skills, advisory mode, unavailable tool counts)? Are the success criteria testable and complete? Is backward compatibility with existing reports preserved?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3.5-test-minion.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
