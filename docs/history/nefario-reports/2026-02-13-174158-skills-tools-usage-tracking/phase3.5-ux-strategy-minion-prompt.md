You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: evaluate journey coherence, cognitive load, and simplification
opportunities across the plan.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
1. Journey coherence: Do the planned deliverables form a coherent user
   experience? Are there gaps or contradictions in the user-facing flow?
2. Cognitive load: Will the planned changes increase complexity for users?
   Are there simpler alternatives that achieve the same goal?
3. Simplification: Can any planned deliverables be combined, removed, or
   simplified without losing value?
4. User jobs-to-be-done: Does each user-facing task serve a real user need,
   or is it feature creep?

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3.5-ux-strategy-minion.md
