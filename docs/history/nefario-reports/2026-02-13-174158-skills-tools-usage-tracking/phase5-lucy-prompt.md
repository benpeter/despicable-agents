You are reviewing code produced during an orchestrated execution.

## Changed Files
- `docs/history/nefario-reports/TEMPLATE.md` (replaced External Skills with Session Resources section, +47/-3 lines)
- `skills/nefario/SKILL.md` (added skills-invoked/orchestrator-tools tracking, +25/-3 lines)

## Execution Context
Read scratch files for context: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-yOkLIr/skills-tools-usage-tracking/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence, CLAUDE.md compliance, intent drift:
- Does the Session Resources section follow existing template patterns?
- Is the naming consistent (skills-used vs skills-invoked mapping)?
- Does this match the original intent of issue #98?
- Are there orphaned references to "External Skills" as a standalone section?
