**Outcome**: Nefario execution reports capture which skills and tools were used during the orchestration session, providing visibility into resource utilization and enabling retrospective analysis of agent behavior patterns.

**Success criteria**:
- Report template includes a section for skills invoked during the session
- Report template includes a section for tools used (with counts if feasible)
- Skills tracking is populated by the calling session from conversation context (no hooks or shell scripting required)
- Tool counts are best-effort — included if extractable from conversation context, omitted gracefully if not
- Existing reports remain valid (new section is additive)

**Scope**:
- In: Report template (`TEMPLATE.md`), skill instructions (`SKILL.md`), report generation guidance
- Out: Runtime hooks, shell-based instrumentation, modifying Claude Code internals, backfilling existing reports
