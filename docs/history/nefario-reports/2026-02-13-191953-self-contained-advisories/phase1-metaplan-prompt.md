MODE: META-PLAN

You are creating a meta-plan — a plan for who should help plan.

## Task

<github-issue>
**Outcome**: Any advisory produced during nefario orchestration (across all phases, not just Phase 3.5) can be understood by a reader who sees only the advisory text. Currently, advisories reference invisible context — task numbers, plan step details, internal decisions — that only make sense inside the agent conversation that produced them. After this change, each advisory carries enough context that a user reading the synthesis, execution report, or task list can evaluate it without opening the originating agent session.

**Success criteria**:
- Each advisory names the concrete artifact, file, or concept it concerns (not "step 1" or "the approach")
- CHANGE descriptions state what they propose in domain terms, not by referencing plan-internal numbering or structure
- WHY descriptions explain the risk or rationale using information present in the advisory itself
- A user seeing only the advisory block can answer: "what part of the system does this affect, what is suggested, and why"
- The verdict format (ADVISE, and potentially APPROVE/BLOCK) is updated if needed to support this

**Scope**:
- In: Advisory format and instructions across all phases and agents that produce advisories; verdict format definition in nefario and reviewer agent prompts
- Out: Verdict routing mechanics, phase sequencing, report template layout

## External Skill Discovery
Before analyzing the task, scan for project-local skills. If skills are
discovered, include an "External Skill Integration" section in your meta-plan
(see your Core Knowledge for the output format).

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand the codebase context
2. Discover external skills:
   a. Scan .claude/skills/ and .skills/ in the working directory for SKILL.md files
   b. Read frontmatter (name, description) for each discovered skill
   c. For skills whose description matches the task domain, classify as
      ORCHESTRATION or LEAF (see External Skill Integration in your Core Knowledge)
   d. Check the project's CLAUDE.md for explicit skill preferences
   e. Include discovered skills in your meta-plan output
3. Analyze the task against your delegation table
4. Identify which specialists should be CONSULTED FOR PLANNING
   (not execution — planning). These are agents whose domain
   expertise is needed to create a good plan.
5. For each specialist, write a specific planning question that
   draws on their unique expertise.
6. Return the meta-plan in the structured format.
7. Write your complete meta-plan to /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-ytuTko/self-contained-advisories/phase1-metaplan.md
