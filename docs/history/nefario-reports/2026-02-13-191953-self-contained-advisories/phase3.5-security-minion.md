VERDICT: APPROVE

No security concerns. All changes are to prompt text and documentation templates with no authentication, authorization, user input processing, or attack surface modifications. The existing secret sanitization pipeline (`prompt.md` sanitization at line 413, per-phase sanitization at spawn time) is not modified and continues to protect against credential leakage across agent boundaries. The SCOPE field introduces no new information exposure -- file paths and component names are already present in the delegation plan that reviewers receive. The addition of the `prompt.md` path to reviewer prompts uses the already-sanitized copy. Self-containment requirements marginally improve security posture by reducing reliance on cross-references that could be manipulated or misleading.
