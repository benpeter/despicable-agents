You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-82NbzX/platform-disclaimers-prerequisites-docs/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Convention adherence and intent alignment: Review the plan for consistency with the project's CLAUDE.md conventions, documentation patterns, and the original intent from GitHub issue #101. Check that task prompts faithfully implement the specialist recommendations without drift. Verify that the conflict resolutions are sound and that no task contradicts the project's established patterns (breadcrumbs, table formats, section ordering in docs/).

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-82NbzX/platform-disclaimers-prerequisites-docs/phase3.5-lucy.md
