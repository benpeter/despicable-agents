You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-82NbzX/platform-disclaimers-prerequisites-docs/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI, and complexity: Review the plan for unnecessary complexity, scope creep, or over-engineering. Are any tasks doing more than needed? Could any be simplified or eliminated? Does the plan add unnecessary abstraction or future-proofing? Check that the documentation additions are proportional to the actual need (this is a documentation-only task for 4 Markdown files).

## Instructions
Return exactly one verdict:
- APPROVE: No concerns from your domain.
- ADVISE: <list specific non-blocking warnings>
- BLOCK: <describe the blocking issue and what must change>

Write your verdict to: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-82NbzX/platform-disclaimers-prerequisites-docs/phase3.5-margo.md

Be concise. Only flag issues within your domain expertise.
