MODE: META-PLAN

You are creating a meta-plan — a plan for who should help plan.

## Task
<github-issue>
The post-execution skip interview (after Phase 4) currently uses single-choice AskUserQuestion options like "Skip to Phase 8" or "Run Phase 5". Change this to a multi-select so the user can pick exactly which post-execution phases to run (e.g., run Phase 5 code review and Phase 8 docs but skip Phase 6 tests and Phase 7 deploy).

## Working Directory
/Users/ben/github/benpeter/2despicable/4

## External Skill Discovery
Before analyzing the task, scan for project-local skills. If skills are
discovered, include an "External Skill Integration" section in your meta-plan
(see your Core Knowledge for the output format).

Project-local skills found in .claude/skills/:
- despicable-lab
- despicable-prompter
- despicable-statusline

## Instructions
1. Read relevant files to understand the codebase context
2. Discover external skills:
   a. Scan .claude/skills/ and .skills/ in the working directory for SKILL.md files
   b. Read frontmatter (name, description) for each discovered skill
   c. For skills whose description matches the task domain, classify as
      ORCHESTRATION or LEAF (see External Skill Integration in your Core Knowledge)
   d. Check the project's CLAUDE.md for explicit skill preferences
   e. Include discovered skills in your meta-plan output
3. Analyze the task against your delegation table
4. Identify which specialists should be CONSULTED FOR PLANNING
   (not execution — planning). These are agents whose domain
   expertise is needed to create a good plan.
5. For each specialist, write a specific planning question that
   draws on their unique expertise.
6. Return the meta-plan in the structured format.
7. Write your complete meta-plan to `/var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-rEm4yP/post-exec-multi-select/phase1-metaplan.md`
