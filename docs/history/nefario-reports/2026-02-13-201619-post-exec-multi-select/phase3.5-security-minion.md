No security concerns from this domain. The multi-select response parsing modifies how user preferences are collected for execution flow control, but does not introduce new attack surface. The user already controls which phases run via freeform flags; this change adds a structured input channel with equivalent risk profile. Semantic parsing by the LLM is consistent with the existing orchestration architecture.
