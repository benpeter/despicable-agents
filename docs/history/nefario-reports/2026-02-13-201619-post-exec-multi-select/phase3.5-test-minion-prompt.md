You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-rEm4yP/post-exec-multi-select/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage: Does the plan adequately address testing? Are there test cases that should be written? Is the verification strategy sufficient? Note that this task modifies a prompt specification file (SKILL.md), not executable code -- standard unit/integration testing is not applicable. Focus on whether the plan's verification steps are adequate and whether any runtime testing strategy is described.
