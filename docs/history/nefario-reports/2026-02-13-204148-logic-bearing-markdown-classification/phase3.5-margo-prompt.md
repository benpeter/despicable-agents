You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-MpyVGO/logic-bearing-markdown-classification/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI, dependency bloat. Specifically:
- Is the plan doing more than necessary to fix the two stated problems (phase-skipping and team assembly)?
- Are any of the 3 tasks unnecessary or over-scoped?
- Could the same outcome be achieved with fewer file changes?
- Is the classification table in Task 2 over-engineered for the actual failure mode (which is just: AGENT.md, SKILL.md, RESEARCH.md were treated as docs)?
- Are the documentation updates in Task 3 proportional, or are they gold-plating?
