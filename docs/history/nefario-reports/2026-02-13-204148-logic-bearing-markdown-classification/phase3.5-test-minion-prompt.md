You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-MpyVGO/logic-bearing-markdown-classification/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Test coverage: Are the verification steps in the plan sufficient? Are there test scenarios missing? The plan modifies system prompt instructions and documentation -- no executable code is produced. Evaluate whether the verification steps (mental walkthroughs, grep checks) adequately validate the changes.
