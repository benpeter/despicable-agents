You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering and YAGNI: Does this plan build more than needed? Is the assembly script justified or could simpler documentation achieve the same goal? Are there tasks that create unnecessary complexity or indirection? Remember: the issue explicitly says "do not dismiss as YAGNI" for the separation work itself, but that does NOT authorize unlimited complexity.
