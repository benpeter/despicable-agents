You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan

## Your Review Focus
Security gaps: Could the adapter format or assembly process introduce injection vectors? Could domain-specific content in DOMAIN.md or section markers in SKILL.md be crafted to escape their boundaries? Is the assembly script (bash text substitution) safe against content injection? Are there secret exposure risks in the adapter format?
