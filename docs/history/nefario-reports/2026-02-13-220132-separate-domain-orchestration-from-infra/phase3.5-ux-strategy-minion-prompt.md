You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: evaluate journey coherence, cognitive load, and simplification opportunities across the plan.

## Delegation Plan

## Your Review Focus
1. Journey coherence: Does the adapter authoring experience form a coherent journey from "fork repo" to "working domain adapter"?
2. Cognitive load: Is the separation boundary easy to understand? Will adapter authors know what to change vs. what to leave alone?
3. Simplification: Can any deliverables be combined or simplified?
4. User jobs-to-be-done: Does each task serve a real adapter author need?
