You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins. Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Your Review Focus
Over-engineering, YAGNI, dependency bloat: Does the plan add unnecessary complexity? Is the 7-task decomposition the simplest way to achieve the goal? Are there tasks that could be merged or eliminated? Is the framing shift over-engineered for what is essentially a preference change?
