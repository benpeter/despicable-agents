You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins. Your role: evaluate journey coherence, cognitive load, and simplification opportunities across the plan.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-O24uAb/enforce-serverless-first-agent-system/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
1. Journey coherence: Do the planned deliverables form a coherent experience? Are there gaps or contradictions in the framing shift?
2. Cognitive load: Will the changes increase complexity for developers using these agents? Are there simpler alternatives?
3. Simplification: Can any deliverables be combined, removed, or simplified?
4. User jobs-to-be-done: Does each task serve a real need, or is it feature creep?
